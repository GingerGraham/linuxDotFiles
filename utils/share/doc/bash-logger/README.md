A flexible, reusable logging module for Bash scripts that provides standardized logging functionality with various configuration options.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a expansion of the originally published [bash_logging GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/GingerGraham/99af97eed2cd89cd047a2088947a5405) published by [@GingerGraham](https://github.com/GingerGraham).

## Primary artifact

The core deliverable of this repository is **[logging.sh](logging.sh)**. It is intentionally kept
as a single, self-contained (and yes, long) Bash file so you can drop it next to your
scripts and `source` it without any packaging steps. Everything else in the repo - docs,
demos, and pipeline scripts - exists to support using that file.

## Features

* Standard syslog log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL, etc.)
* Console output with color-coding by severity
* Configurable stdout/stderr output stream split
* Optional file output
* Optional systemd journal logging
* Customizable log format
* UTC or local time support
* INI configuration file support
* Runtime configuration changes
* Special handling for sensitive data
* Secure-by-default newline sanitization to prevent log injection
* Secure-by-default ANSI code stripping to prevent terminal manipulation attacks
* Configurable log line length limits for DoS resistance
* TOCTOU race condition protection during log file creation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Source the logging module
source /path/to/logging.sh

# Initialize the logger
init_logger

# Log messages
log_info "Application started"
log_error "Something went wrong"
```

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for detailed installation and basic usage instructions.

## Common Use Cases

### Basic Script Logging

```bash
source /path/to/logging.sh
init_logger
log_info "Script starting"
```

See: [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)

### Logging to File

```bash
init_logger --log "/var/log/myapp.log" --level INFO
```

See: [Initialization](docs/initialization.md)

### Using Configuration Files

```bash
init_logger --config /etc/myapp/logging.conf
```

See: [Configuration](docs/configuration.md)

### Journal Integration

```bash
init_logger --journal --tag "myapp" --facility "local0"
```

See: [Journal Logging](docs/journal-logging.md)

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite to verify all functionality. To run the tests:

```bash
make test
# Or directly:
cd tests && ./run_tests.sh
```

Additional testing tools are available via the Makefile:

```bash
make coverage        # Run tests with kcov code coverage
make test-junit      # Generate JUnit XML report
make sonar-analysis  # Full coverage + SonarQube analysis
```

> **Note:** Coverage and SonarQube targets require additional tools (kcov, sonar-scanner).
> See [Testing Documentation](docs/testing.md#code-coverage-and-static-analysis) for setup details.

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) and [Testing](docs/testing.md) for more information.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

The project uses pre-commit hooks for code quality checks (ShellCheck, MarkdownLint, etc.).
The CI lint workflow runs these same hooks, so tool versions are centralized in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
See [docs/PRE-COMMIT.md](docs/PRE-COMMIT.md) for setup instructions.
