### Development Notes

This version represents the cumulative result of approximately 13 iterative commits made
between March and July 2025 during the gist phase of development. These commits were made
without descriptive messages as features were being explored and refined. The changes listed
above reflect the complete feature set that existed by July 2, 2025, when the module reached
functional maturity before being formalized into a repository structure.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-03-03

  * `-v|--verbose` - Enable debug level logging
* Four log levels: DEBUG (0), INFO (1), WARN (2), ERROR (3)
* Configurable console and file output
* Timestamp inclusion in log messages (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
* Log file validation and permission checking
* Demo script (`log-demo.sh`) showing usage examples
